Text Adventure

Using random numbers, prompts and css elements to create a interactive text based adventure story game. 

The player will be prompted to choose between two given variables and depending on which they choose, the story will change accordingly.

I will be using ramdom numbers as variables for damage dealt and damage recieved when player is faced against monsters.

Also, there will be a max health and once damage recieved exceeds that number, player dies and loses the game.
